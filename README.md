# GROUP 38 APPLICATION: SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being

This is a simple app which is catered to Brunel Students, implementing both the front-end and back-end frameworks using React and Spring Boot. Some of the back-end has been provided in the labs, but others fully made from scratch. 

# Versions/Commits
Look to the highest number for the recent version of the contributions made by each student. Earlier versions represents some prototypes/versions that were put into place.
Commits may or may not reach intended amount, but due to effort could have been separated out. 

# Back-End
The backend was writtern in Spring Boot, making use of Data and Security as well as MY SQL for the login and database storing.

# Frontend
The front-end part of the project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is made using React/CSS. HTML links were provided but not the site's themselves due to it being a early prototype.
